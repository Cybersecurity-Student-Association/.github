## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Old Dominion University's (ODU) Cyber Security Student Association (CS2A) GitHub profile! The purpose of CS2A is to provide its members with resources to excel in the cybersecurity field. By going to [the repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Cybersecurity-Student-Association/repositories), you will find some of the following resources:
1. The CS2A website
2. Resources created by students
3. Certification resources
4. CTF challenges and answers

This profile is ever-changing. As more students become members, more knowledge will be added to the repositories in this profile. The officers of CS2A hope you enjoy and learn something new!
